# Deployment Changes Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to transition from Render deployment to Vercel deployment while ensuring user data persistence in MongoDB.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Render Deployment Configuration
- Deleted `render.yaml` file

### 2. Added Vercel Deployment Configuration
- Created `server/vercel.json` for backend deployment configuration
- Updated root `vercel.json` for frontend deployment configuration
- Added `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with detailed deployment instructions

### 3. Enhanced Server Configuration
- Improved MongoDB connection with retry logic
- Added graceful shutdown handling
- Enhanced CORS configuration for Vercel deployments
- Added environment variable validation
- Improved error handling and logging

### 4. Fixed User Model Issues
- Removed duplicate [healthDetails](file:///Users/madanthambisetty/Downloads/Healthcare%20App%20Design%204%20copy/server/models/User.js#L135-L135) field definition
- Added database indexing for better performance
- Added a dedicated method for updating last login

### 5. Updated Authentication Routes
- Modified login route to use the new last login update method
- Improved error handling and logging

### 6. Added Environment Example Files
- Created `server/.env.example` with proper configuration examples

### 7. Updated Documentation
- Modified `README.md` to include Vercel deployment information
- Created `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive deployment instructions

## MongoDB Data Persistence

The application already properly stores user data in MongoDB, including:
- User authentication information (email, hashed password, email verification status)
- Personal health details (height, weight, blood group, date of birth, gender, etc.)
- Profile completion status
- Login timestamps

This ensures that existing users don't need to re-enter their personal details every time they log in.

## Vercel Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment Steps:
1. Create a new project in Vercel
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the root directory to `/server`
4. The build will be handled automatically by Vercel
5. Configure environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token generation
   - `EMAIL_USER` - Email for sending OTPs
   - `EMAIL_PASS` - Password for email account
   - `FRONTEND_URL` - URL of your frontend deployment
   - `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`

### Frontend Deployment Steps:
1. Create a new project in Vercel
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the root directory to `/`
4. Set the build command to `npm run build`
5. Set the output directory to `dist`
6. Configure environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL` - URL of your backend deployment (e.g., https://your-backend.vercel.app/api)

### Important Notes:
1. Deploy the backend first to get the API URL
2. Update the frontend environment variable with the backend URL
3. Deploy the frontend
4. Update the backend's `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable with the frontend URL
5. Redeploy the backend

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
EMAIL_USER=your_email_for_sending_otp
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

### Frontend:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app/api
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` in backend environment variables matches your frontend deployment URL
2. **Email Verification Not Working**: Check `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` environment variables
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify `MONGODB_URI` is correct and your MongoDB cluster allows connections from Vercel IPs

### MongoDB Atlas Configuration:
1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account
2. Create a new cluster
3. Add a database user with read/write permissions
4. Configure network access (add Vercel IPs or allow access from anywhere for testing)
5. Get the connection string and add it to your `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
