# Healthcare App Troubleshooting Guide

## Network Error: Failed to Fetch When Logging In

### Problem
Users are experiencing "Network error: Failed to fetch" when trying to log in to the Healthcare App.

### Root Causes
1. Backend service not deployed or not running on Render
2. Incorrect API URL configuration
3. CORS configuration issues
4. Network connectivity problems

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling in the API service
- Implemented specific network error detection
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Created API connection test functions

#### 2. Improved Configuration
- Added fallback mechanisms for API URL
- Enhanced environment variable handling
- Added connection status indicators in the UI

#### 3. UI Improvements
- Added API status indicators (online/offline)
- Implemented warning banners for connection issues
- Added real-time API health checks

### Current Status
The backend service at `https://m-m-healthcare-backend.onrender.com` is currently not responding (404 errors). This indicates that either:

1. The service is not deployed correctly
2. The service is deployed but not running
3. The service name or URL is incorrect

### Immediate Steps to Resolve

#### 1. Check Render Deployment
1. Log in to your Render account
2. Navigate to the `m-m-healthcare-backend` service
3. Check the deployment status:
   - Should show "Live" status
   - Check logs for any errors
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

#### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these variables are set in Render:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - A secure random string
- `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail address for sending emails
- `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` - Gmail app password
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"
- `PORT` - Set to "10000"
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Set to "https://healthcare-app-design-4.vercel.app"

#### 3. Check Service Logs
Look for common issues in the logs:
- Database connection errors
- Missing environment variables
- Port binding issues
- Startup errors

#### 4. Redeploy if Necessary
If the service is not running:
1. Trigger a manual deployment
2. Check the build logs for errors
3. Verify the start command works: `cd server && npm start`

### Fallback Solutions

#### 1. Local Development
For testing purposes, you can run the backend locally:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:10000`.

#### 2. Update API URL for Local Testing
Change the VITE_API_URL environment variable to:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:10000/api
```

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. API Service (`src/services/api.ts`)
- Added robust error handling for network issues
- Implemented fallback API URL detection
- Added connection testing functionality
- Enhanced logging for debugging

#### 2. App Component (`src/App.tsx`)
- Added API status indicators
- Implemented warning banners for connection issues
- Added real-time health checks

#### 3. Login Page (`src/components/LoginPage.tsx`)
- Added API status display
- Improved error messaging
- Added connection status indicators

### Testing the Fixes

#### 1. Unit Tests
```bash
# Test API connection
node test-api-connection.js

# Test deployment configuration
node check-deployment.js
```

#### 2. Manual Testing
1. Try to access the API health endpoint directly
2. Check browser console for network errors
3. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
4. Test login functionality with proper error messages

### Prevention for Future

#### 1. Monitoring
- Set up uptime monitoring for the backend service
- Implement automated health checks
- Add alerting for service downtime

#### 2. Documentation
- Maintain updated deployment guides
- Document environment variable requirements
- Keep troubleshooting steps current

#### 3. Error Handling
- Continue improving error messages
- Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Implement offline functionality where possible

### Contact Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Render status page for service outages
2. Contact Render support for deployment issues
3. Verify MongoDB Atlas connectivity
4. Check Gmail account settings for email service

### Common Error Messages and Solutions

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| "Network error: Failed to fetch" | Backend service unreachable | Check Render deployment status |
| "Service not found" | Incorrect API URL | Verify service name and URL |
| "CORS error" | CORS configuration issues | Check server CORS settings |
| "Invalid token" | Authentication issues | Clear browser storage and re-login |

This troubleshooting guide should help resolve the network error issues and prevent them from occurring in the future.
