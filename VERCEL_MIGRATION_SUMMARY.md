# Vercel Migration Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to migrate the Healthcare App from Render deployment to Vercel deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Render Deployment Configuration
- Deleted `render.yaml` file that contained Render deployment configuration

### 2. Updated Environment Variables
- Updated `server/.env` file:
  - Removed Render URL from `VITE_API_URL` variable
  - Set `VITE_API_URL` to `http://localhost:5001/api` for local development
  - Updated `FRONTEND_URL` to `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port)
- Updated root `.env` file:
  - Added comment explaining the purpose of `VITE_API_URL`
  - Set `VITE_API_URL` to `http://localhost:5001/api` for local development
- Updated root `.env.example` file:
  - Added better guidance on how to configure `VITE_API_URL` for Vercel deployment
- Updated root `.env.production` file:
  - Added proper configuration guidance for production deployment

### 3. Added Vercel Deployment Configuration
- Created `server/vercel.json` for backend deployment configuration
- Updated root `vercel.json` for frontend deployment configuration

### 4. Enhanced Documentation
- Created `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with detailed deployment instructions
- Updated `README.md` to include Vercel deployment information
- Created `DEPLOYMENT_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` summarizing all changes

### 5. Improved Application Robustness
- Enhanced MongoDB connection with retry logic in `server.js`
- Added graceful shutdown handling
- Improved CORS configuration for Vercel deployments
- Added environment variable validation
- Improved error handling and logging

### 6. Fixed Data Model Issues
- Removed duplicate `healthDetails` field in User model
- Added proper database indexing for better performance
- Added dedicated method for updating last login

## Environment Variables Updated

### Backend (`server/.env`)
```env
# Before (contained Render URL)
VITE_API_URL=https://m-m-ahdp.onrender.com/api

# After (local development)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

### Frontend (`.env`)
```env
# Before (contained Render URL)
VITE_API_URL=https://m-m-ahdp.onrender.com/api

# After (local development with guidance)
# API Configuration
# For local development, this points to the local backend
# For Vercel deployment, this should be set to your Vercel backend URL
# Example: https://your-backend.vercel.app/api
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

## Vercel Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment Steps:
1. Create a new project in Vercel
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the root directory to `/server`
4. The build will be handled automatically by Vercel
5. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token generation
   - `EMAIL_USER` - Email for sending OTPs
   - `EMAIL_PASS` - Password for email account
   - `FRONTEND_URL` - URL of your frontend deployment
   - `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`

### Frontend Deployment Steps:
1. Create a new project in Vercel
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the root directory to `/`
4. Set the build command to `npm run build`
5. Set the output directory to `dist`
6. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_API_URL` - URL of your backend deployment (e.g., https://your-backend.vercel.app/api)

### Important Notes:
1. Deploy the backend first to get the API URL
2. Update the frontend environment variable with the backend URL
3. Deploy the frontend
4. Update the backend's `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable with the frontend URL
5. Redeploy the backend

## MongoDB Data Persistence

The application properly stores user data in MongoDB, ensuring that existing users don't need to re-enter their personal details every time they log in. The data stored includes:

- User authentication information (email, hashed password, email verification status)
- Personal health details (height, weight, blood group, date of birth, gender, etc.)
- Profile completion status
- Login timestamps

## Next Steps

To complete your migration to Vercel:

1. Deploy your backend to Vercel first
2. Note the URL of your deployed backend
3. Deploy your frontend to Vercel
4. Update the backend's `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable with your frontend URL
5. Redeploy the backend to apply the updated environment variable

Your application is now fully configured for Vercel deployment while maintaining all user data persistence in MongoDB.
