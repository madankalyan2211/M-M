## üêõ Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Email not sending"
- [ ] Check `EMAIL_USER` in `server/.env` is correct
- [ ] Check `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` is the 16-char app password (not your Gmail password)
- [ ] Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on Google account
- [ ] Check spam/junk folder
- [ ] Check server terminal for email errors

### ‚ùå "MongoDB connection error"
- [ ] If using local MongoDB:
  - [ ] Run `mongosh` to verify MongoDB is running
  - [ ] Run `brew services start mongodb-community` if not running
- [ ] If using Atlas:
  - [ ] Check connection string is correct
  - [ ] Verify username/password in connection string
  - [ ] Check IP whitelist in Atlas (add 0.0.0.0/0 for testing)

### ‚ùå "Port already in use"
- [ ] Find process using port:
  ```bash
  lsof -i :5000
  ```
- [ ] Kill the process:
  ```bash
  kill -9 <PID>
  ```
- [ ] Or change `PORT=5001` in `server/.env`

### ‚ùå "CORS error"
- [ ] Verify backend is running on port 5000
- [ ] Verify frontend is running on port 5173
- [ ] Check `FRONTEND_URL` in `server/.env` matches frontend URL

### ‚ùå "Module not found" errors
- [ ] Delete `node_modules` folder
- [ ] Delete `package-lock.json`
- [ ] Run `npm install` again
